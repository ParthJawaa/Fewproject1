# Fewproject1

I started the project with the most basic idea of reducing the content on one single page.

like if we look at the actual website the navbar is full of items and reading and paying attention to all of them could be a bit overwhelming.

afterwards i  gave the site a gradient look to make it look more art-y (if thats a word).

I did pretty well on the main objective that was reducing the content and making navigation simple

a part of my design that i was personally really impressed with was the cards idea on index.html that i used, it just looked fancy to me.

one part i struggled to get right was responsiveness of the website, like i made a property that when you hover on an image it gets a bit bigger, but when i tried to do that on a smaller screen size i messed up, which took me a while to sort using media queries (something i found very useful).

resources that really helped: W3schools, StackOverflow and a bit of random google searches.

I would have done a bit better if i didnt run out of time, just because of covid i had all the assesments together on my shoulders so i got a bit behind in this unit as it was a big and important assignment.

I didnt get enough time to finish the festivals 2022 and the city commisions page. Sorry about that.

but overall, really enjoyed the assignment, taught me a lot about time-management, desinging which was my weak area.

Thanks Ben!!!
