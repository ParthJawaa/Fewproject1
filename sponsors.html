    <h2 id="suph2">Thank you!</h2>
    <p id="supp">Hello and thank you all contour 556 supporters.<br><br> We closed our first fundraising campaign through chuffed on 26th June 2021.<br><br> We received $9150 through the platform and a further $6600 directly.<br><br> That is a great start for the
        2022 event and it is wonderful to have support from such a wide group of people, some of whom we haven't met yet!</p>
    <h2 id="suph2">
        Your donation makes art possible.
